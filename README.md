> curated lists of shit that actually works, not comprehensive lists of everything that exists

## wtf is this?

tired of "awesome" lists with 500 links where 490 are dead projects from 2018? 

we only list shit that:
- ✅ **actually fucking works** right now
- ✅ **people use in production** (not just demos)
- ✅ **doesn't make you cry** when you try to use it
- ✅ **maintained by humans** who respond to issues

## the wtf philosophy

**awesome lists:** "here's every single thing that ever existed in this category"

**wtf lists:** "here's the 5-10 things that won't waste your time"

we're the marie kondo of tech lists - if it doesn't spark joy (or actually work), it's out.

## current wtf lists

## creating a wtf list

want to create your own wtf list? here's the rules:

### what gets in:
- ✅ **battle-tested** - used in production by real companies
- ✅ **actively maintained** - commits in last 6 months
- ✅ **actually works** - you tried it, it didn't break
- ✅ **good docs** - you can figure out how to use it
- ✅ **community** - people help when you're stuck

### what stays out:
- ❌ **academic projects** - cool papers, shit code
- ❌ **abandoned repos** - last commit from 2019
- ❌ **todo lists** - "coming soon" doesn't count
- ❌ **marketing sites** - if it's all landing page, no code
- ❌ **your side project** - unless 1000+ people actually use it

### the template:

```markdown
# WTF [Category]

> [one line describing what this solves]

## the short list (5-10 max)

| name | what it does | why it's here | who uses it |
|------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| [Tool](link) | brief description | why it doesn't suck | real companies |

## honorable mentions (stuff that's ok)

- [Thing](link) - good but has issues with X
- [Other](link) - works but steep learning curve

## avoid like plague

- BadTool - looks good, will ruin your life
- HypeTool - all marketing, no substance
```

## contributing to wtf

### for existing lists:
1. **use the thing first** - no theoretical recommendations
2. **prove it works** - show production usage or real examples
3. **explain why** - "it's popular" isn't a reason
4. **follow the format** - keep it consistent

### for new wtf lists:
1. **pick a real problem** - "awesome X but better" isn't enough
2. **curate ruthlessly** - 5 great tools > 50 mediocre ones
3. **test everything** - if you haven't used it, don't list it
4. **update regularly** - dead projects get removed

## the anti-patterns we fight

**awesome list syndrome:**
- 847 items in alphabetical order
- half are archived repos
- no indication what actually works
- maintained by bots

**hype-driven development:**
- newest = best mentality  
- frameworks with no real users
- solutions looking for problems
- javascript framework of the week

**enterprise bullshit:**
- "enterprise-grade" meaning "expensive"
- vendor lock-in disguised as features
- consultancy-driven complexity
- architecture astronauts

## hall of shame

things that sound good but will fuck your day:

- **overhyped frameworks** that die after 6 months
- **enterprise solutions** that need 47 microservices to say hello
- **bleeding edge tools** that bleed all over your production
- **academic projects** that work great in papers

## wtf philosophy expanded

### we believe:
- **working > perfect** - ship code that works, optimize later
- **simple > complex** - if you need a PhD to use it, it sucks
- **real > theoretical** - battle-tested beats benchmark-optimized
- **maintained > innovative** - boring and working > exciting and broken

### we don't give a shit about:
- **github stars** - popularity contest metrics
- **hacker news points** - hype doesn't equal quality  
- **conference talks** - demos aren't production
- **vendor marketing** - they're not your friend

## join the movement

tired of wading through awesome lists to find something that works?

**start a wtf list:**
1. pick a category you know
2. list 5-10 things that actually work
3. test them yourself
4. keep it updated
5. help developers save time

**contribute to existing lists:**
1. try the tools
2. share real experience
3. call out broken shit
4. suggest better alternatives

WTFPL - do what the fuck you want with this

**remember: if it's not good enough for production, it's not good enough for the list**
